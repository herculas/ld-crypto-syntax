/**
 * A context definition defines a local context in a node object. A context definition MUST be a map whose keys MUST be
 * either terms, compact IRIs, IRIs, or one of the keywords `@base`, `@import`, `@language`, `@propagate`, `@protected`,
 * `@version`, or `@vocab`.
 *
 *    - If the context definition has an `@base` key, its value MUST be an IRI reference, or `null`.
 *    - If the context definition has an `@direction` key, its value MUST be one of `"ltr"` or `"rtl"`, or `null`.
 *    - If the context definition has an `@import` keyword, its value MUST be an IRI reference. When used as a reference
 *      from an `@import`, the referenced context definition MUST NOT include an `@import` key itself.
 *    - If the context definition has an `@language` key, its value MUST have the lexical form described in
 *      [BCP47](https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47), or `null`.
 *    - If the context definition has an `@propagate` key, its value MUST be `true` or `false`.
 *    - If the context definition has an `@protected` key, its value MUST be `true` or `false`.
 *    - If the context definition has an `@type` key, its value MUST be a map with only the entry `@container` set to
 *      `@set`, and optionally an entry `@protected`.
 *    - If the context definition has an `@version` key, its value MUST be a number with the value `1.1`.
 *    - If the context definition has an `@vocab` key, its value MUST be an IRI reference, a compact IRI, a blank node
 *      identifier, a term, or `null`.
 *
 * The value of keys that are not keywords MUST be either an IRI, a compact IRI, a term, a blank node identifier, a
 * keyword, `null`, or an expanded term definition.

/**
 * An expanded term definition is used to describe the mapping between a term and its expanded identifier, as well as
 * other properties of the value associated with the term when it is used as key in a node object.
 *
 * An expanded term definition MUST be a map composed of zero or more keys from `@id`, `@reverse`, `@type`, `@language`,
 * `@container`, `@context`, `@prefix`, `@propagate`, and `@protected`. An expanded term definition SHOULD NOT contain
 * any other keys.
 *
 * When the associated term is `@type`, the expanded term definition MUST NOT contain keys other than `@container` and
 * `@protected`. The value of `@container` is limited to the single value `@set`.
 *
 *    - If the term being defined is not an IRI or a compact IRI, and the active context does not have an `@vocab`
 *      mapping, the expanded term definition MUST include the `@id` key.
 *      Term definitions with keys which are of the form of an IRI or a compact IRI MUST NOT expand to an IRI other than
 *      the expansion of the key itself.
 *    - If the expanded term definition contains the `@id` keyword, its value MUST be `null`, an IRI, a blank node
 *      identifier, a compact IRI, a term, or a keyword.
 *    - If the expanded term definition has the `@reverse` keyword, it MUST NOT have `@id` or `@nest` entries at the
 *      same time, its value MUST an IRI, a blank node identifier, a compact IRI, or a term. If an `@container` entry
 *      exists, its value MUST be `null`, `@set` or `@index`.
 *    - If the expanded term definition contains the `@type` keyword, its value MUST be an IRI, a compact IRI, a term,
 *      `null`, or one of the keywords `@id`, `@json`, `@vocab`, or `@none`.
 *    - If the expanded term definition contains the `@language` keyword, its value MUST have the lexical form described
 *      in [BCP47](https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47), or `null`.
 *    - If the expanded term definition contains the `@index` keyword, its value MUST be an IRI, a compact IRI, or a
 *      term.
 *    - If the expanded term definition contains the `@context` keyword, its value MUST be a valid context definition.
 *    - If the expanded term definition contains the `@nest` keyword, its value MUST be either `@nest`, or a term which
 *      expands to `@nest`.
 *    - If the expanded term definition contains the `@prefix` keyword, its value MUST be `true` or `false`.
 *    - If the expanded term definition contains the `@propagate` keyword, its value MUST be `true` or `false`.
 *    - If the expanded term definition contains the `@protected` keyword, its value MUST be `true` or `false`.
 *
 * Terms MUST NOT be used in a circular manner. That is, the definition of a term cannot depend on the definition of
 * another term if that term also depends on the first term.
